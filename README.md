# board-viz
Command line tool for the visualization for chess board states. It starts at a board state given by a Forsyth-Edwards Notation string. Then a move in algebraic move notation is entered and the board is printed accordingly.

 This tool is meant to be connected to a chess program for debugging purposes.
