# board-viz
Command line tool for the visualization for chess board states. It starts at a board state given by a Forsyth-Edwards Notation string. Then a move in algebraic move notation is entered and the board is printed accordingly.

 This 'tool' could potentially be connected to a chess program for debugging purposes (such as directing input from a log file) but really just a small project to learn C++.
